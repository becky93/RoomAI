    #Pedro Ramirez = Tuco Ramirez – The Ugly in the film The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Fictional person) – During phase 1 of his turn, he may choose to draw the first normalcard from the top of the discard pile or from the deck. Then he draws the second normalcard from the deck. (4 life points)
    Rose_Doolan    = "Rose_Doolan"
    #Rose Doolan = She is considered to have a Scope (Appaloosa in older versions) in play at all times; she sees the other players at a distance decreased by 1.
